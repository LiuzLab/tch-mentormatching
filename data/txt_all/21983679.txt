Outcomes Research Trust Fund (PCORI)  
Present Widespread Implementation of a Patient-centered Online Therapy for
Adolescent Traumatic Brain Injury  
Role Description: The aim of this study is to facilitate the implementation of
family choice Family Problem Solving Therapy (F-PST) in real-world practice at
10 children’s hospitals and rehabilitation facilities. Our efforts will
address the following aims: 1) Implement family choice F-PST into clinical
practice at 10 children’s hospitals and rehabilitation centers and measure
impact on patient/parent-reported adolescent behavior problems and quality of
life; 2) Identify patient, therapist, health system, and community factors
that facilitate or impede implementation or efficacy of family choice F-PST;
and 3) Evaluate maintenance of the clinical application of family choice F-PST
by sites after 18 months.

PMC Citations indicate the number of times the publication was cited by
articles in PubMed Central, and the Altmetric score represents citations in
news articles and social media. (Note that publications are often cited in
additional ways that are not shown here.) Fields are based on how the National
Library of Medicine (NLM) classifies the publication's journal and might not
represent the specific topic of the publication. Translation tags are based on
the publication type and the MeSH terms NLM assigns to the publication. Some
publications (especially newer ones and publications not in PubMed) might not
yet be assigned Field or Translation tags.) Click a Field or Translation tag
to filter the publications.
