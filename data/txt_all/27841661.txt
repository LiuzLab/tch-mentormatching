overview

I am an Assistant Professor of Pediatric Critical Care Medicine at Baylor
College of Medicine where I practice clinically full time at Texas Children’s
Hospital (TCH) in Houston, TX in the 166 bed Lester and Sue Smith Legacy Tower
Pediatric ICU where we care for over 5,000 critically ill pediatric patients
annually. I am board certified in both pediatrics and pediatric critical care
medicine. I care for patients aging from several weeks old through
approximately 21 years old with one or more organ systems at risk of, or
actively, failing.  
  
Utilizing my background in biomedical engineering I optimize the incorporation
of technological advancements into pediatric intensive care clinical practice.
Most recently I have been investigating the application of wireless/remote
monitoring systems in pediatric patients building upon an initial pilot study
in which I showed that using partially wireless pulse oximetry reduces
episodes of loss of signal integrity secondary to motion artifact in pediatric
subjects. Through my work on AICORE-kids (NIH R61HD105593 under PI Dr. Ananth
Annapragada), I have been working with a multidisciplinary group to utilize
machine learning applications to risk-stratify COVID-19 and MIS-C pediatric
patients including prediction of likely outcomes based on electronic health
record and biomarker data.  
  
In my advisory role in the TMC Innovation Accelerator and by facilitating
connections with device companies and engineering colleges/universities, I
work to keep the division of Pediatric Critical Care medicine at Texas
Children’s Hospital at the forefront of medical device and software
innovation. My goal is to re-design pediatric critical care units through
optimizing the utilization of current and emerging technologies and devices to
improve patient care, optimize billing and documentation accuracy and reduce
administrative burdens on providers to improve patient, family, and provider
experiences.

Evaluation of a Novel Remote Vital Sign Monitor Compared to Traditional
Inpatient Monitoring in Cardiac Shunt-Dependent Children  
Role Description: This is a clinical study to test the VITLS platform
(vitlsinc.com - Houston, TX) against gold standard inpatient monitoring
devices in children with congenital heart disease. VITLS Tego is an FDA
cleared device specifically designed for pediatric patients for wireless
continuous vital sign monitoring that measures heart rate, respiratory rate,
temperature, and oxygen saturation.

PMC Citations indicate the number of times the publication was cited by
articles in PubMed Central, and the Altmetric score represents citations in
news articles and social media. (Note that publications are often cited in
additional ways that are not shown here.) Fields are based on how the National
Library of Medicine (NLM) classifies the publication's journal and might not
represent the specific topic of the publication. Translation tags are based on
the publication type and the MeSH terms NLM assigns to the publication. Some
publications (especially newer ones and publications not in PubMed) might not
yet be assigned Field or Translation tags.) Click a Field or Translation tag
